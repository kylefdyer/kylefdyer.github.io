## Burgers

`2024-04-17`

My daughter loves a good burger. Her favorite is [Au Cheval in Chicago IL](https://auchevaldiner.com/chicago/). I just found out about a new (to me) place in Omaha called Charred. It's on my list to checkout with her next time we go out. 

Current list of her favorites:
- [Au Cheval in Chicago IL](https://auchevaldiner.com/chicago/)
- [Cheeseburgers in Omaha NE] (https://www.ineedcheeseburgers.com/)
- [Freddy's](https://www.freddys.com/)

My favorite is [Block 16 in Omaha NE](https://block16omaha.com/). 

## Rich Hickey

`2024-04-16`

I'm a "seasoned" software developer and I still love coding. One thing you learn to hate as a programmer is time. I don't mean time zones, though they are enduring fountain of bugs. I'm talking about "state" and the complexly hidden in every variable that changes over time. I'll never forget watching this talk by Rich Hickey: [Are We There Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScEPu1cs4l0&t=1807s). It's pretty old too but he does a great job articulating how good software systems (and programmers) need to reason about "things" that "change" over time.

When you write a calculator you get to ignore time and change. Given the same inputs the results are always the same: 10 plus 10 always equals 100 (in binary). But most software systems are useful _because_ their results change over time (even when offered the same inputs). If my weather app always gave me the same result for "what's the high for today" I wouldn't like it. Systems that model the world become _part_ of the  world.  The trick is to unlearn what you have learned. There is no such thing as an entity-changing-over-time in the real world. Our system designs need to respect this. No man crosses the same river. Look now, there is water, and look again later... there is other water. "River" is a psychological construct _we_ super impose on a sequence. A river is a useful thing in conversations. But be wary of putting them in your code.

## Luigi, Inc. @ Mr Toads Pub

`2024-04-01`

I morn the end of the weekend on Sunday evenings. Last night I was feeling down and decided to get out the house and read a little. I ended up at Mr. Toads and discovered it was Jazz night. Folks- [Sunday night Jazz has been going on at Mr Toads every week for my entire life](https://www.mrtoadspub.com/music/). I had no idea.

## Easter Service 2024

`2024-04-01`

My family and I recently started attending an [Anglican service](https://c4so.org/anglicanism/) regularly. 

This Sunday was Easter. The sermon focused on an account of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from [Mark chapter 16 verses 5-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+16%3A5-8&version=ESV). Reading it again just now, I notice the resurrection _itself_ isn't described. Rather, we are placed at the scene after the fact, overhearing the good news as it is told for the first time to the most loyal of Jesus' friends. Good News our pastor beautifully summarized:

> Don't be afraid. He's just ahead of you, on the way. You will see Him in a little while.

Come Lord Jesus.

## Music Coming Up

`2024-03-29`

Coral music has been in heavy rotation for me lately. Apple's _The Story of Classical_ (a nine-part companion guide to classical music) opened me up to these early coral sounds.
Here is an incredible example: 
[Josquin des Prez / Mille regretz](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dkfVzCZ68_Q)

I'm swooper excited to attend these two live classical music performances this April:

- Apr 7 at 3:15pm [Sing Omaha & Creighton University Chamber Choir](https://calendar.boomte.ch/single/uA8wA8K0xW2A8cH9lM6cw)
- Apr 10 at 7:00pm [Romantic trios for violin, cello and piano](https://www.omahachambermusic.org/salud-al-amor?fbclid=IwAR2UYFAD5wQCobnOdXW6d8wxE6hO1yf1rNzSltvv7TALxl58ggGJ2GQ4Wf0)

## Good Friday - Day Off

`2024-03-29`

Today is a holiday at the railroad. 
I am running errands, eating out and napping. 
The local Aldis grocery store now has
 [Aldis merch](https://www.aldi.us/products/aldi-gear/): fanny packs! hats! and shirts.
My wife was not too impressed with any of it. 
Even after I modeled each item for her.


## Wendell Berry Film

`2024-03-28`

My wife is getting her MFA in poetry at UNO. So I'm reading more about poetry than I ever have. I came across this documentary of Wendell Berry, [Look at See](https://www.lookandseefilm.com/). The best part of the film is a [reading by Wendell Berry of his poem "The Objective"](https://vimeo.com/327923084).

Here is a snippet:

> ...  
> The once-enslaved, the once-oppressed,  
> 
> were now free to sell themselves to the highest bidder  
> 
> and to enter the best paying prisons in pursuit of the objective,  
> 
> which was the destruction of all enemies,  
> 
> which was the destruction of all obstacles,  
> 
> which was to clear the way to victory,  
> 
> which was to clear the way to promotion,  
> 
> to salvation,  
> 
> to progress,  
> 
> to the completed sale,  
> 
> to the signature on the contract,  
> 
> which was to clear the way to self-realization, to self-creation,  
> 
> from which nobody who ever wanted to go home would ever get there now,

## Spring bike ride

`2024-03-28`

Earlier this month my son and I attempted a 40 mile spring time bike ride. A co-worker shared this route with me. It took us from [Aksarben Village in Omaha NE to Malvern IA](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/45823266) via the South Omaha and [Wabash trace](https://www.wabashtrace.org/) bike trails.

We didn't make it. My wife rescued us 30 miles into it. Long story. But I'd like to try it again sometime. I think it would be a good solo ride whenever I get around to making time for that.


## Union Pacific / UNMC - Go Baby Go event

`2024-03-27`

I always wanted a one of those toy ride-on cars growing up. I would see one and think... that's toy  you can *drive*?! aw yeah! 

Never did get one. 

 This week I signed up with some fellow employees at Union Pacific at the next [Go Baby Go Event](https://www.unmc.edu/mmi/services/pt/gobabygo/index.html). We'll host and partner with UNMC professionals and students to modify ride-on toy cars for young children with motor difficulties.  
 
 Now I get to help some other kid get one.

## Next Lecture on the books

`2024-03-27`

April 4th 2024 7:00PM [Chuck Hagel Forum in Global Leadership Event](https://www.unomaha.edu/special-events/chuck-hagel-forum-in-global-leadership/index.php)

## Last Night's Lecture by Dr. Jan Grabowski 

`2024-03-27`

Update on the excellent talk by Dr. Jan Grabowski last night
-  I understand nationalism it bit more. 
-  I appreciate the work of archivists more too. (The friend who invited me is an [archivist](https://www.unomaha.edu/criss-library/archives-and-special-collections/hagel-archives.php) here in town.)

Dr. Grabowski is a historian and focuses on Poland during WWII. He's had to defend himself in Polish court against charges of defaming Edward Malinowski, mayor of a Polish village before WWII. The charges against Dr. Grabowski relate to a movement in Poland referred to as the "Polish memory wars". This 2021 New Yorker article : [The Historians Under Attack for Exploring Poland’s Role in the Holocaust](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-historians-under-attack-for-exploring-polands-role-in-the-holocaust) provides a great summary.

 > "Like other contemporary autocratic movements, Poland’s Law and Justice Party, which has been in power since 2015, promises to restore society to a lost self-understanding—to bring back an old and comforting story of Poland as “noble victim,” as Grabowski put it ..."

 During the Q/A someone asked why the Polish right wing cares so much about this. Why would it focus on a restoration of this "comforting story"? 
Dr. Grabowski answered that nationalism needs there to be a "seige". A world history where anti-polish dangers can be compared to antisemitism is a useful history to the nationalists. 

Another person asked if anything harmful has been done to materials in the archives historians rely on for their work. Nobody has tried to disturb the archives but his access to them had been restricted. 



## Lecture Tonight: Dr. Jan Grabowski

`2024-03-26`

I love lectures, tours and art openings. There's just something special about any event with a reception.

My wife's friend is going and I heard about it. It's a somber topic. But I'm still excited.  [Producing a 'Usable' Past: Holocaust Distortion and New Threats to the Memory of the Holocaust

## Climbing Trip Coming UP: Red Rocks!

`2024-03-26`

Stoked (unsure if my temperament allows me to live up to the term) for some multi pitch climbing in Red Rock Canyon this spring.  My buddy and I are using [Red Rock Climbing Guides](https://www.redrockclimbingcenter.com/climbingguides) this time. The Tour De France has a race going on in the canyon that same weekend... so we'll see how that goes.

## Those That Can't Love You

`2024-03-26`

Loved reading through, [101-things-for-my-past-self](https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/101-things-for-my-past-self/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter) this morning. Got to it via hacker news.

Favorite quote so far: 

> "Don't fall in love with something that can't love you back. Companies do not spend a week crying when you break up with them. ...". 

The sentiment reminds me of this beautiful song  [Listen to the One Who Loves You](https://genius.com/Roo-panes-listen-to-the-one-who-loves-you-lyrics) By Roo Panes. I appreciate the encouragement to focus on the voices of people I can personally relate too.
