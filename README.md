### Union Pacific / UNMC - Go Baby Go event

I always wanted a one of those toy ride-on cars growing up. I would see one and think... that's toy  you can *drive*?! aw yeah! Never did get one. 

 This week I signed up with some fellow employees at Union Pacific at the next [Go Baby Go Event](https://www.unmc.edu/mmi/services/pt/gobabygo/index.html). We'll host and partner with UNMC professionals and students to modify ride-on toy cars for young children with motor difficulties.  
 
 Now I get to help some other kid get one.

### Next Lecture on the books

### Last Night's Lecture by Dr. Jan Grabowski 

Update on the excellent talk by Dr. Jan Grabowski last night
-  I understand nationalism it bit more. 
-  I appreciate the work of archivists more too. (The friend who invited me is an [archivist](https://www.unomaha.edu/criss-library/archives-and-special-collections/hagel-archives.php) here in town.)

Dr. Grabowski is a historian and focuses on Poland during WWII. He's had to defend himself in Polish court against charges of defaming Edward Malinowski, mayor of a Polish village before WWII. The charges against Dr. Grabowski relate to a movement in Poland referred to as the "Polish memory wars". This 2021 New Yorker article : [The Historians Under Attack for Exploring Poland’s Role in the Holocaust](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-historians-under-attack-for-exploring-polands-role-in-the-holocaust) provides a great summary.

 > "Like other contemporary autocratic movements, Poland’s Law and Justice Party, which has been in power since 2015, promises to restore society to a lost self-understanding—to bring back an old and comforting story of Poland as “noble victim,” as Grabowski put it ..."

 During the Q/A someone asked why the Polish right wing cares so much about this. Why would it focus on a restoration of this "comforting story"? 
Dr. Grabowski answered that nationalism needs there to be a "seige". A world history where anti-polish dangers can be compared to antisemitism is a useful history to the nationalists. 

Another person asked if anything harmful has been done to materials in the archives historians rely on for their work. Nobody has tried to disturb the archives but his access to them had been restricted.

### Lecture Tonight

I love lectures, tours and art openings. There's just something special about any event with a reception.

My wife's friend is going and I heard about it. It's a somber topic. But I'm still excited.  [Producing a 'Usable' Past: Holocaust Distortion and New Threats to the Memory of the Holocaust

### Climbing Trip Coming UP: Red Rocks!

Stoked (unsure if my temperament allows me to live up to the term) for some multi pitch climbing in Red Rock Canyon this spring.  My buddy and I are using [Red Rock Climbing Guides](https://www.redrockclimbingcenter.com/climbingguides) this time. The Tour De France has a race going on in the canyon that same weekend... so we'll see how that goes.

### That Can Love you 

Loved reading through, [101-things-for-my-past-self](https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/101-things-for-my-past-self/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter) this morning. Got to it via hacker news.

Favorite quote so far: 

> "Don't fall in love with something that can't love you back. Companies do not spend a week crying when you break up with them. ...". 

The sentiment reminds me of this beautiful song  [Listen to the One Who Loves You](https://genius.com/Roo-panes-listen-to-the-one-who-loves-you-lyrics) By Roo Panes. I appreciate the encouragement to focus on the voices of people I can personally relate too.
