### Climbing Trip Coming UP: Red Rocks!

Stoked (not sure I even have the temperment that allows me to use that word- ever) for some multi pitch climing in Red Rock(s?) Canyon in May.  Using [Red Rock Climbing Guides] (https://www.redrockclimbingcenter.com/climbingguides) this time. Going to be there the same time as the Tour De France... so... we'll see how that goes.

### That Can Love you 

Loved reading throught this post today, [101-things-for-my-past-self](https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/101-things-for-my-past-self/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter).

Favorite quote so far: "Don't fall in love with something that can't love you back. Companies do not spend a week crying when you break up with them. ...". The sentiment reminds me of this beautiful song  [Listen to the One Who Loves You](https://genius.com/Roo-panes-listen-to-the-one-who-loves-you-lyrics) By Roo Panes.
