### Last Night's Lecture by Dr. Jan Grabowski 

Update on the excellent talk by Dr. Jan Grabowski last night
-  I understand nationalism it bit more. 
- And I understand more the value of the work of archivists. (The friend who invited me is an archivists here in town.)

Dr. Grabowski is a historian and focuses on Poland during WWII. He's had to defend himself in Polish court against charges of defaming Edward Malinowski, mayor of a Polish village before WWII. The charges against Dr. Grabowski relate to a movement in Poland referred to as the "Polish memory wars". This 2021 New Yorker article : [The Historians Under Attack for Exploring Poland’s Role in the Holocaust](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-historians-under-attack-for-exploring-polands-role-in-the-holocaust) provides a great summary.

 > "Like other contemporary autocratic movements, Poland’s Law and Justice Party, which has been in power since 2015, promises to restore society to a lost self-understanding—to bring back an old and comforting story of Poland as “noble victim,” as Grabowski put it ..."

 During the Q/A someone asked why the Polish right wing cares so much about this. Why would it focus so much a restoration of this comforting story? 
Grabowski answered that nationalism needs there to be a "seige" upon the nation. A world history where anti-polish dangers can be compared to antisemitism is a useful history to Poland’s nationalist. 

Another person asked if the Polish authorities had done anything to purge or destroy materials in any of the archives that historians rely on to refute Holocaust distortion. Dr. Grabowski answered that no, there hasn't been any action to disturb the archives but that his access to them had been restricted.

### Lecture Tonight

I love lectures, tours and art openings. There's just something special about any event with a reception.

My wife's friend is going and I heard about it. It's a somber topic. But I'm still excited.  [Producing a 'Usable' Past: Holocaust Distortion and New Threats to the Memory of the Holocaust

### Climbing Trip Coming UP: Red Rocks!

Stoked (not sure I even have the temperament that allows me to use that word- ever) for some multi pitch climbing in Red Rock(s?) Canyon in May.  Using [Red Rock Climbing Guides](https://www.redrockclimbingcenter.com/climbingguides) this time. Going to be there the same time as the Tour De France... so... we'll see how that goes.

### That Can Love you 

Loved reading through, [101-things-for-my-past-self](https://www.approachwithalacrity.com/101-things-for-my-past-self/?utm_source=tldrnewsletter) this morning. Got to it via hacker news.

Favorite quote so far: 

> "Don't fall in love with something that can't love you back. Companies do not spend a week crying when you break up with them. ...". 

The sentiment reminds me of this beautiful song  [Listen to the One Who Loves You](https://genius.com/Roo-panes-listen-to-the-one-who-loves-you-lyrics) By Roo Panes. I appreciate the encouragement to focus on the voices of people I can personally relate too.
